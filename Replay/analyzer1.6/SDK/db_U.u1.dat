# Example database for the UserDetector embedded in UserApparatus
# The following can be freely formatted.
#
# One may use validity time stamps here as needed:
# [ 1995-01-01 13:45:00 ]
# These time stamps follow the same incremental validity scheme
# as the run database

# The database keys need to be prefixed with the detector's prefix
# (usually <apparatus-name>.<detector-name>)
# This may seem redundant since the prefix is already implied by the
# name of this file, but it allows for easy migration of keys to
# other (non file-based) database systems.

U.u1.detmap = 3 2 0 4 0
U.u1.nelem = 5

# The following keys are optional. If missing, defaults will apply:
# angle = 0, pedestals = 0, gains = 1
# This behavior needs to be implemented in the detector's ReadDatabase function

U.u1.angle = 0.0
U.u1.pedestals = 15. 22. 14.5 11.2 17.6
U.u1.gains = 3.3 3.22 3.54 4.05 3.42
