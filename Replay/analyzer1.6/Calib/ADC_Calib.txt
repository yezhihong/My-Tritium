Calibrating the ADC's:
----------------------

To use the signal amplitudes reported by PMT's, it is necessary to identify
the pedestal of the ADC, and determine a mapping between ADC channel and
the number of photons seen by the photo-multiplier tube.

Current, this mapping is performed with an offset for the pedestal, and
a linear coefficeint to scale the read-out.

You can use 'id_pedestal.C' to determine these parameters.

STEPS:
------

1. Use the analyzer to process a raw data file and create a TTree
   containing the raw ADC distributions. For example, to for the A1 aerogel
   detector on the Left HRS you might have the following lines in the
   output control (often output.def) file:
   
   block L.aero1.*
   block L.a1.*


   and corresponding, add the line:

   HRSL->AddDetector( new THaCherenkov("aero1", "Aerogel 1 n=1.015" ));

   to the setup script (often setup.C).

2. After loading the file containing the TTree (typically named "T" for the
   analyzer), load the 'id_pedestals.C' file at the analyzer[] prompt:

   analyzer [1] .L id_pedestals.C+

   The '+' is present to compile the routines, since the code uses some
   features of C++ that Cint cannot handle easily.

3. Finally, run the code, using a select pattern for the detector of
   interest. You will need a few pieces of information to make this work.

   id_pedestals takes 4 required parameters, and 2 optional parameters:
   
   void id_pedestals(TTree* T, const char* expr, int minch, int maxch,
		        Double_t goal = 500., Double_t MaxADC = 1000.,
			Double_t MinADC = 10.)

   REQUIRED:
   --------
       T  = is the TTree from which to extract the ADC information

     expr = is the pattern used to extract the ADC values. It should be
            similar to the pattern used to T->Draw(...) the ADC values, but
            with a '%d' replacing the specific channel number.

    minch = minimum channel (often 0) to calibrate

    maxch = maximum channel number to calibrate
    
   OPTIONAL:
   --------
       goal = the final 'value' the first peak (after the pedestal) should
              be calibrated to arrive at.

     MaxADC = the maximum number of ADC channels ABOVE THE PEDESTAL the
              first peak should be found at in the raw ADC distribution.
              This can be set generously large, but it also determines the
              bin size. If you are experiencing problems, try adjusting
              this parameter.

     MinADC = the minimum number of ADC channels ABOVE PEDESTAL the
	      first peak might be found. Keep this small unless the routine
	      gets stuck on a fluctuation on the pedestal's tail.

   For each channel, a histogram of the ADC distribution after pedestal
   subtraction will be displayed and the first peak fitted. After all
   channels are complete, the pedestals and calibration parameters are
   printed to the screen where they can be cut & pasted into the database.

   Finally, an overall histogram of the channel vs. calibrated ADC
   distribution is displayed.

EXAMPLES:
--------

   a. To calibrate the ADC values readout for A1 on the Left HRS, with the
      primary single-photoelectron peak at 1000:

       analyzer [2] id_pedestals(T, "L.aero1.a[%d]",0,23,1000.,2000.);

   b. The new S2 (S2m) detector has very small ADC amplitudes, around 50
      above pedestal. So, MaxADC has to be set smaller than normal.

       analyzer [3] id_pedestals(T, "L.s2.ra[%d]",0,15,500.,200);

   c. S1 has much LARGER amplitudes than the other detectors, so modify
      the expected ranges to match:

       analyzer [8] id_pedestals(T, "L.s1.ra[%d]",0,5,1000.,4000.,50)
