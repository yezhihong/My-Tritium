<h1>Adding and removing a detector</h1>

Suppose you have just written a new detector class and want to try it out.
The easiest way to do so is via the
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaApparatus.html#THaApparatus:AddDetector">AddDetector()</a>
method of the apparatus class. For example, your script could do the following:
<pre>
   // Instantiate the Right Arm HRS apparatus and add it to the list of
   // apparatuses to be analyzed
   THaApparatus* HRSR = new THaHRS("R","Electron HRS");
   gHaApps->Add( HRSR );

   // Create an instance of the new hyper scintillator detector
   THaDetector* hs = new THaHyperScintillator("hs","Hyper Scintillator");

   // Add this detector to the Right Arm HRS
   HRSR->AddDetector( hs );

   // ... do your analysis
</pre>
That's it! No need to compile anything (except your new detector class, 
of course).  This looks awfully simple, in fact too good to be true! Welcome
to the power of object-oriented programming.
<p>
Of course, you must add appropriate database entires for your
detector, unless you have hardcoded everything (urgh).
<p>
A detector added to an apparatus in this way will work like any other
detector associated with the apparatus in the sense that its standard
processing methods will be called in the correct order and with the
correct arguments.  That is, Decode() and CoarseProcess()/FineProcess() or
CoarseTrack()/FineTrack() will be called as expected.  The new detector
may even call methods of other detectors within the same apparatus and
access any global physics variables available, within the same restrictions
that apply to detectors instantiated in the apparatus's constructor.
<p>
There is no real limitation to using this method as compared to 
instantiating a detector in the apparatus's constructor. It should work with
any detector objects, including tracking detectors.
However, AddDetector() should not be used to add
detectors whose methods or global physics variables are to be used
by any default detectors of the apparatus.  The reason is simply that
other detectors should not rely on detectors being present that
are defined "manually" by the user in the steering script. It is easy
to forget to define such a detector or to comment out the instantiation.
Of course, well-written code should test for the detector's presence and
should not crash, but correct behavior is not guaranteed in that case.
In brief, detectors that other detectors need to be present should be
instantiated in the apparatus's constructor.
<p>
How to clean up? Normally, no need to bother. In a simple analysis
session, you will probably exit ROOT after the analysis anyway and
everything will be automatically deleted. If you do want to clean up
yourself:
<pre>
   // Be careful not to delete the detector before deleting the apparatus!
   // Otherwise the analyzer will crash - guaranteed.
   // Exiting ROOT will do this automatically anyway, so usually don't 
   // bother with it.
   gHaApps->Delete();  // Deletes only default detectors of the apparatuses.
   delete hs;
</pre>
<p>
To make a detector more permanent, you could add its
instantiation to the apparatus's constructor. For example:
<pre>
void THaMyHRS::THaMyHRS( const char* name, const char* description ) :
  THaHRS( name, description )
{
  // Constructor. Defines the standard detectors for MyHRS.
  // NB: The standard HRS detectors (VDC, S1, S2) are defined
  // in the THaHRS constructor.

  AddDetector( new THaHyperScintllator("hs","Hyp Scint"));
}
</pre>
However, writing a new apparatus inheriting from THaHRS just to add your
own detectors is not really necessary unless you need to do special processing
that <b>requires</b> the presence of those detectors.

<p>
<p>
How about <b>removing</b> a detector from a standard apparatus? 
This is not as trivial. Of course, one could provide a RemoveDetector() method.
However, for the reasons mentioned above, this could cause trouble if
other detectors or parts of the analysis algorithm (e.g. beta calculation)
depend on the presence of the detector you want to remove. Because of this,
there is no support for simple removal of a detector in the present 
version of the analyzer.
<p>
For this reason, the standard HRS includes
only minimal instrumentation (VDC, S1, S2).  Normally, those
detectors are always present, so there is no need to remove detectors.
Additional detectors can usually just be added via AddDetector().
<p>
With the present analyzer, if you feel that you
absolutely need to remove a detector from an
apparatus, you will need to write a new apparatus class (modeled after
the existing one). You will need to ensure, by inspection, that none of 
the remaining detectors and/or algorithms depend on the detector that 
you remove.
