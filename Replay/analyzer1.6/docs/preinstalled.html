<h1>Using the preinstalled C++ Analyzer</h1>

Precompiled binaries of the latest version of the Analyzer are
currently installed on the Hall A counting house analysis machines 
(adaql4-8). To run the Analyzer, log into any
standard account on these computers, for example as adaq,
and type
<pre>
  % analyzer
</pre>

As installed, the Analyzer uses the default database in
the location pointed to by the environment variable DB_DIR.
The Hall A staff makes an effort to keep this database reasonably 
up-to-date for completed experiments. If you wish to analyze older data,
the default database might be a good starting point. However, 
if you wish to use a customized set of database files
specific to your experiment (usually the case for the current experiment), 
you will need to re-define DB_DIR to
point to the location of that database before starting the Analyzer.
The organization of the database is explained
<a href="database.html">here</a>.
<p>

The pre-installed analyzer may not work in certain accounts if 
the PATH and/or LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables have been
changed from the system defaults. If this is the case, you should
correct the login script(s) of the problematic account.
To restore the system defaults, you may execute one of the following 
commands:

For csh/tcsh shells:
<pre>
  % source /adaqfs/apps/env/login.adaq
</pre>
For bash shells:
<pre>
  % source /adaqfs/apps/env/profile.adaq
</pre>
