<h3>Getting started</h3>
Before you start programming your new detector class, you will need to
make a few decisions:
<ul>
<li> Which apparatus(es) will your detector belong to?  If it is an existing 
    apparatus, for example <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaHRS.html">THaHRS</a>, 
    then your detector class needs to be included in that apparatus's list of detectors.
    Including it there is very easy, just use the
    <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaApparatus.html#THaApparatus:AddDetector">AddDetector()</a>
    or write a derived apparatus class that creates the detector in its constructor
    (see <a href="add-det.html">adding and removing detectors</a>). If it is a new
    apparatus (e.g. a new spectrometer), you will need to write a class
    for it as well (see <a href="apparatus.html">creating an Apparatus</a>.)
    <p>

<li> Does you detector resemble an existing detector?  For example,
    a new scintillator should normally resemble the existing scintillators
    (<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaScintillator.html">THaScintillator</a>).
    If so, you may be able to use the existing class. You will need to
    think of a unique name for the detector and compile a new database
    entry for it, in particular geometry information (e.g. number of
    paddles). 
    <p>

    If an existing detector class is not suitable for your detector, e.g.
    because the behavior of some functions needs to be different, then
    you should let your new class to inherit from the existing class,
    overriding only those functions that must do different things.
    <p>

    To emphasize: It is <b>not</b> always necessary to write a new class
    for a new detector! If you have several essentially identical
    detectors (e.g. scintillators), you should try to write a 
    <b>single</b> class that can handle all of them. 
    Each object of this class type will then represent one of these
    detectors.  The individual detectors are distinguished by
    their unique name (see <a href="ref-names.html">naming conventions</a>).
    <p>

<li> If your detector does not resemble any existing one, then your
    detector class should inherit directly from one of the generic 
    detector classes:
    <p>
    <ul>

      <li><a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaDetector.html">THaDetector</a> is the simplest
       base class. It can be used for beamline instrumentation
       (e.g. <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaBPM.html">THaBPM</a>) and similar
       miscellaneous equipment.
       <p>

   <li><a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaSpectrometerDetector.html">THaSpectrometerDetector</a>
       is a THaDetector to be included in a Spectrometer
       (<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaSpectrometer.html">THaSpectrometer</a>).
       Actual detector classes should not inherit directly from this class,
       but rather from one of the following three, unless you know exactly
       what you are doing.
       <p>

   <li><a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaTrackingDetector.html">THaTrackingDetector</a>
       can be used as a base class for implementing tracking detectors
       such as VDCs. Here, a "tracking detector" represents equipment that
       is used to find the "physics tracks" in the spectrometer.
       In general, "physics tracks" are tracks that can be used for
       target/vertex reconstruction.
       <p>

       Some detectors, such as an FPP, do reconstruct tracks, but those
       tracks are not the "physics tracks". Rather, they are "instrumentation
       tracks" that are used within the detector only. Thus, an FPP should
       not be a THaTrackingDetector, but rather a THaNonTrackingDetector.
       <p>

   <li><a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaNonTrackingDetector.html">THaNonTrackingDetector</a>
       is the base class for any spectrometer detectors that are not 
       tracking detectors, e.g. scintillators.
       <p>

   <li><a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaPidDetector.html">THaPidDetector</a> is a
       specialized THaNonTrackingDetector that provides support for 
       PID. Use it as the base class for all true PID detectors, e.g.
       Cherenkovs and shower counters.  
       <p>

       For performance reasons, do not use this class if your
       detector currently does not do any PID calculations, even though
       it might in principle be used for PID (e.g. scintillators).
       If you add PID calculations later, all you have to do is change
       the class inheritance to add PID support.
       <p>

 </ul>
 If appropriate, create your own detector subclass structure, e.g. 
 THaPidDetector <- THaCherenkov <- THaGasCherenkov.
 This might result in a cleaner design and might help avoid code
 duplication. However, be careful not to overcomplicate things.
 The above scheme for Cherenkovs could be useful if there is at least one
 common method for all Cherenkovs (e.g. PID processing).

</ul>

Once you have decided where your new detector fits into the class hierarchy,
take one of the existing classes as a template and start rewriting it.
There are a few requirements to keep in mind. Your class must
<ul>
<li> follow the <a href="coding-rules.html">coding standards</a>
     for the analyzer;
<li> inherit from THaDetector or one of its subclasses;
<li> define a <a href="#decode">Decode()</a> method;
<li> if it is a 
     <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaNonTrackingDetector.html">THaNonTrackingDetector</a>, 
     define a <a href="#coarseprocess">CoarseProcess()</a> and
     <a href="#fineprocess">FineProcess()</a> method; these can be dummy
     routines if no special processing is needed or if you don't know
     yet what best to do here;
<li> if it is a 
     <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaTrackingDetector.html">THaTrackingDetector</a>, 
     define a <a href="#coarsetrack">CoarseTrack()</a> and
     <a href="#finetrack">FineTrack()</a> method; again, these can be
     dummy routines if appropriate.
</ul>

Also, your class should
<ul>
  <li> define appropriate <a href="#init">initialization</a> routines,
      i.e. an Init() method and/or a ReadDatabase() and/or DefineVariables()
      method. These methods should obtain all detector-specific parameters
      (geometry, mapping, calibrations, etc.) from a database and should
      register any symbolic variables to be accessible for 
      dynamic tests and histograms in the global variable list 
      <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaVarList.html">gHaVars</a>.
</ul>
<p>

A simple example for a detector class is the generic scintillator
class <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaScintillator.html">THaScintillator</a>.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="init">
<h3>Initialization</h3>
Every detector must have a public Init() method of type<p>

<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaAnalysisObject.html">THaAnalysisObject</a>::EStatus Init( const
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TDatime.html">TDatime</a>& date ) <p>

This method should obtain all detector-specific parameters
(geometry, mapping, calibrations, etc.) from the database.
It should <b>not</b> be called from the constructor(s). 

Init() is called by the standard analyzer at the beginning of the
analysis of a run. The 
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TDatime.html">TDatime</a>
object that is passed contains the time stamp of the prestart event of the
run. It should be used to do time-dependent initializations, such as
retrieving appropriate calibration parameters from tye database.

While you can write your own Init() function, it is recommended that
you use the default Init() provided by the
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaAnalysisObject.html">THaAnalysisObject</a> base class.
This default function will establish the connection to the database
for you. In analyzer version 1.0, the database is simply a collection
of plain text files. There is support time-dependence with
a 1-day granularity and less (see <a href="database.html">database</a>).

If you do use the default Init() method, you should (but do not have to)
implement one or both of the following methods in your detector class.
(These methods may be protected to prevent direct calls.)
<p>
virtual Int_t ReadDatabase( const
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TDatime.html">TDatime</a>& date )
<p>
virtual Int_t DefineVariables( Emode mode )
<p>
The first action in ReadDatabase() should be to open the plaintext database file
corresponding to the detector (as determined by the detector's and
containing apparatus's names) as well as the time stamp of the current
run. A convenience function
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaAnalysisObject.html#THaAnalysisObject:OpenFile">OpenFile()</a>
is available for this purpose. 
You can use the FILE* handle returned by OpenFile() with
standard C file I/O commands (fscanf, fgets etc.)
to read the file. The file must be closed before leaving ReadDatabase().
<p> 

DefineVariables() is called after ReadDatabase() and should be used for
<a href="#gvar">setting up global symbolic variables</a>.

If your detector does not need a database file, you can put your
initializations either in Init() or in DefineVariables(), or write a
ReadDatabase() method that does not actually open any files.  If you do not
need any initialization, you do not need to implement any functions.

<hr>
<a name="gvar">
<h3>Global Variables</h3>
Any data of your detector that you want to be accessible within the
global analyzer context should be registered as global symbolic variables
in the global list gHaVars.  Any variables that you want to have available
in <a href="test-guide.html">tests/cuts</a> or output to a ROOT file
must be registered in this way. You can register variables either
with a series of calls to<p>
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaVarList.html#THaVarList:Define">gHaVars->Define( ... )</a>
<p>
or with a single call to<p>
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaAnalysisObject.html#THaAnalysisObject:DefineVariables">
DefineVariables</a>( const VarDef* vars )<p>.

The second form is recommended. Both forms can be mixed since DefineVariables()
simply make the appropriate calls to Define(). You must call Define()
explicitly in order to define multidimensional arrays.<p>

VarDef is an array whose entries have the structure (see VarDef.h)
<pre>
  struct VarDef {
    const char*      name;     // Variable name
    const char*      desc;     // Variable description
    Int_t            type;     // Variable data type (see VarType.h)
    Int_t            size;     // Size of array (0/1 = scalar)
    const void*      loc;      // Location of data
    const Int_t*     count;    // Optional: Actual size of variable size array
  };
</pre>
A typical sequence for defining global variables (e.g. in SetupDetector())
would be
<pre>
  #include "VarDef.h"

  VarDef vars[] = {
    { "nhit", "Number of hits",  kInt,   0,      &fNhit },
    { "adc",  "ADC values",      kFloat, fNelem, fADC },
    { "csum", "Cluster sums",    kFloat, MAXCLU, fCsum, &fNclusters },
    { NULL }
  };
  DefineVariables( vars );
</pre>
This will register three global variables called "nhit", "adc", and
"csum", prefixed with the apparatus name and detector name, e.g. "L.s1.nhit".
The data types (kInt, kFloat, see VarType.h) <b>must</b> correspond
exactly to the types of the variables (5th field). "nhit" is a scaler
(size = 0), "adc", a fixed-size array of size fNelem, and "csum" is
a variable-size array of maximum size MAXCLU and actual size contained in
the variable fNclusters. The actual size is allowed to
change from event to event. The 5th field (&fNhit, fADC, fCsum) must
be the address of the variable or the first array element. (You could also
write &fADC[0] instead of fADC if you like to type a lot.)
The 6th field (&fNclusters), if not NULL, <b>must</b> be
the address of a variable of type Int_t. (If the 6th field is not specified,
it is automatically initialized to NULL.)
The definitions <b>must always</b> end with a final { NULL }
entry or your program <b>will</b> crash.

<hr>
<a name="decode">
<h3>Decoding</h3>
Every detector must have a Decode() method. It must be of type<p>

Int_t Decode( const <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaEvData.html">THaEvData</a>& 
  evdata )<p>

Within the standard analyzer, Decode() will be called for every
physics event. (You can override this behavior if you use your
own apparatus class.) The event's raw data can be accessed via
the methods of the <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaEvData.html">THaEvData</a>
object that is passed as the argument
of Decode().  At the minimum, your Decode() function should find
the detector's information in the event buffer and move it to data members
of your class.  Of course you may apply further processing if appropriate.
<p>
Within Decode() you must only do processing that does not require
information from any other detectors.  If you need information from
other detectors, put the corresponding code either in the 
<a href="#coarseprocess">CoarseProcess()</a>/<a href="#coarsetrack">CoarseTrack()</a>
or 
<a href="#fineprocess">FineProcess()</a>/<a href="#finetrack">FineTrack()</a>
method of the detector class or in the Reconstruct() method of the
apparatus class to which your detector belongs.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="coarseprocess">
<h3>Coarse processing</h3>
The CoarseProcess() method is relevant only for non-tracking detectors.
Its type is<p>

Int_t CoarseProcess( 
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TClonesArray.html">TClonesArray</a>& 
 tracks ) <p>

In the standard analyzer, CoarseProcess() is called for every 
non-tracking detector after 
<a href="#coarsetrack">CoarseTrack()</a> has been called for all tracking 
detectors. Information on the tracks found for the current event, if any,
is passed in the
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TClonesArray.html">TClonesArray</a>.
This array contains zero or more 
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaTrack.html">THaTrack</a> objects.
The track information is "Coarse", i.e.
only preliminary reconstruction has been performed.
<p>

Here is a simple example how to retrieve the information from all tracks
passed in the array:
<pre>
  #include < THaTrack.h >

  int ntrack = tracks.GetLast()+1; 

  for( int i = 0; i < ntrack; i++ ) {
    THaTrack* theTrack = static_cast < THaTrack* > ( tracks.At(i) );
    if( !theTrack ) continue;
    Double_t fpx    = theTrack->GetX();     // x-position in fp
    Double_t fpy    = theTrack->GetY();     // y-position in fp
    Double_t fpth   = theTrack->GetTheta(); // theta wrt normal to fp
    Double_t fpph   = theTrack->GetPhi();   // phi wrt fp x-axis
    //... do computations ...
  }
</pre>

Within CoarseProcess(), you cannot generally 
use information from any other detectors except tracking detectors. 
There is no guarantee that the non-tracking detectors are processed in
any particular order. Therefore, this method should operate only on the tracks
passed in the array.
<p>


<hr>
<a name="fineprocess">
<h3>Fine processing</h3>
Like <a href="#coarseprocess">CoarseProcess()</a>, the 
FineProcess() method is relevant only for non-tracking detectors.
Its type is<p>

Int_t FineProcess( 
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TClonesArray.html">TClonesArray</a>& 
 tracks ) <p>

FineProcess() is
called for every non-tracking detector after all focal-plane track 
reconstruction has been done by the tracking detectors. Thus, this method
should be used for any detector-specific processing that requires 
precise track information.  Track information can be obtained from the
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TClonesArray.html">TClonesArray</a>
of <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaTrack.html">THaTracks</a> in the same manner as
described above for <a href="#coarseprocess">CoarseProcess()</a>.
<p>

Within FineProcess(), you can use all "coarse processing" information
from all other detectors as well as all information from all tracking
detectors. To access information from another detector, either
retrieve a global physics variable defined by that detector or
use the public interface of that detector. For example:

<pre>
  // Retrieve global physics variable called "r.s.x"
  #include "THaVarList.h"
  #include "THaVar.h"
  Double_t x;

  THaVar* pvar = gHaVars->Find("r.s.x");
  if( pvar ) x = pvar->GetValue();

  //-------------------------------------------------------

  // Call method GetX() of detector "mydet"
  #include "THaApparatus.h"
  #include "THaMyDet.h"       //as appropriate
  Double_t x;

  THaMyDet* mydet = static_cast< THaMyDet* >( fApparatus->GetDetector("mydet"));
  if( mydet ) x = mydet->GetX();

</pre>

<hr>
<a name="coarsetrack">
<h3>Coarse tracking</h3>
This method is only relevant for tracking detectors. It has the type
<p>

Int_t CoarseTrack( 
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TClonesArray.html">TClonesArray</a>& 
 tracks ) <p>

CoarseTrack() is called immediately after Decode() has been called for
all detectors.
The <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TClonesArray.html">TClonesArray</a>
of tracks is empty when the function is called and is intended to be
an output variable. Tracking detectors are not guaranteed to be 
processed in a particular order, so the only information that can
be assumed to be valid in this function is the decoded data for all
detectors.
<p>

CoarseTrack() is expected to reconstruct tracks from the decoded data
in the fastest possible way, create 
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaTrack.html">THaTrack</a> objects, and put them in
the output array.  For convenience, the
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaTrackingDetector.html">THaTrackingDetector</a>
base class defines a method 
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaTrackingDetector.html#THaTrackingDetector:AddTrack">AddTrack</a>
that can be used to add tracks to the array.  This method should be be used
for this purpose unless there is a good reason not to.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="finetrack">
<h3>Fine tracking</h3>
Like <a href="#coarsetrack">CoarseTrack()</a>, this method is 
only relevant for tracking detectors. It has the type
<p>

Int_t FineTrack( 
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TClonesArray.html">TClonesArray</a>& 
 tracks ) <p>

FineTrack() is called after Decode(), CoarseTrack(), and
CoarseProcess() have been executed for all detectors.
Upon entry, the 
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TClonesArray.html">TClonesArray</a>
of tracks contains the tracks found by <a href=#coarsetrack>CoarseTrack()</a>.
Tracking detectors are not guaranteed to be 
processed in a particular order, so the only information that can
be assumed to be valid in this function is the decoded and coarse-processed 
data for all detectors.
<p>

FineTrack() is expected to reconstruct tracks in the most precise way 
possible, using the decoded data and
the coarse tracks as input.  The function should modify the
tracks already present in the input array rather than add new tracks.
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaTrack.html">THaTrack</a>
provides several Set() methods that allow altering track data.
