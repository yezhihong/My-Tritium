<h1>Design Overview</h1>
The Analyzer makes extensive use of object-oriented techniques, in particular
of inheritance and polymorphism. All classes that operate on physics data
inherit from a common base class, 
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaAnalysisObject.html">THaAnalysisObject</a>.
Deriving from this base class are three main groups of classes:
<ul>
  <li>Individual detectors belong to a Detector class hierarchy (base class
      <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaDetectorBase.html">THaDetectorBase</a>).
  <li>Spectrometers (and similar major installations) are abstracted in an
      Apparatus class hierarchy (base class
      <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaApparatus.html">THaApparatus</a>).
      Generally, Apparatuses are collections of detectors that are analyzed in a particular way.
  <li>Higher-level physics analysis, such as kinematics calculations,
      vertex determination, and energy loss corrections, is done in Physics Modules (base class
      <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/html/THaPhysicsModule.html">THaPhysicsModule</a>).
      (Such calculations can also be done in an analysis script, but Physics Modules offer
      better performance and the ability to define new global variables easily.)
</ul>
All three types of objects, Apparatuses, Detectors, and Physics Modules, are kept in
lists that are processed during replay. In setting up the replay, it
is up to the user which objects to place in the lists.
<p>

The behavior of existing analysis modules can be modified or extended
easily by using class inheritance. In such a case, the only code that
needs to be written is the implementation of the new feature.  For
example, the standard Cherenkov detector class currently only
calculates the total sum of ADC amplitudes. For a new type of
Cherenkov counter, or to do a more sophisticated analysis of the
standard Cherenkov detectors, one might want to calculate separate ADC
sums for certain groups of PMTs.  To do so, one would write a new
class inheriting from the standard Cherenkov class, which could
contain as little as one function, performing the additional
calculations, and the corresponding data members.  New types of
detectors and even entire spectrometers, as well as new types of
physics calculations, can be added similarly easily, again using class
inheritance.  No change to and no rebuilding of the core program is
necessary to support such new modules.
